# Number-Generator
This is the number generator for the identities of membership under a separably distributed structure. The number generating algorithm is designed by Hao Jiang. 

The Python code of the application is 'Number Generator.py'; if Python 3.9 or higher is installed in the computer, 'Number Generator.py' can run by double click, since all the libraries in 'Number Generator.py' are the Python's build-in libraries; see 'instructions.pdf' for details about it.

The file 'number_generator_code_part.py' is the core part of the application, which can be used for further modification & distribution.
